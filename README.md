PlaceHolderCableReassign
========================

Automatically reassign cable data after selecting a new value set from a PlaceHolder in Eplan P8

See my blog post at http://www.stlm.ca/?p=406 for a description of the problem, or my video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8Nf2elNzcY&feature=plcp for a demonstration.

This EPlan P8 API Add-In implements an Event Handler to respond to the "onActionEnd.String.XMPlaceHolderAssignRecordAction" event which is fired after the user Assigns a value set to a PlaceHolder object.
